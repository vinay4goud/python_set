# set is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. In Python sets are written with curly brackets.

a = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

print (a)

# add items

a.add("orange")
print(a)

# ADD MULTIPLE ITEMS  TO SE  , USING  update() METHOD

a.update(["mango", "grapes"])

print(a)

# length of the set 

print(len(a))

# remove item 

a.remove ("banana")

print(a) # If the item to remove does not exist, remove() will raise an error.

# we can remove  item using  discard() method

a.discard("banana")

print(a) # If the item to remove does not exist, discard() will NOT raise an error.

#  pop() method also  can be used  to remove  item by giving  an index or  by default  it  removes  last  item  if any  index is not mentioned

x = a.pop()

print (x)

print(a)

# clear() method empties the set

a. clear()

print(a)

# DEL keyword will delete the set completely

b = { "apple","banana", "chery"}

del b

print(b)

#  set() constructor
# it is  possible to use  set() constructor to make  a set

a = set(("apple", "banana", "cherry"))

print(a) #  output  will be {""apple", "banana", "cherry" }
